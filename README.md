# MBMP-Pyomo

A collection of **Pyomo** solutions to the practical applied problems from *Model Building in Mathematical Programming* by H. Paul Williams.

This repository contains implementations of optimization models for 29 practical problems presented in the book, designed to illustrate modeling techniques and the application of Pyomo for linear, integer, and nonlinear programming.  Some of the problems have been grouped together due to sharing the same data/background, but having a different formulation and approach.

## About

*Model Building in Mathematical Programming* is a widely used reference for learning practical approaches to formulating optimization problems. Each problem in this repository demonstrates:

- Problem formulation and assumptions  
- Pyomo model implementation  
- Solution using open-source solvers  

This repository is intended as a learning resource and reference for students, researchers, and practitioners.
